#### It's been a long journey.

I used to dub music off the radio onto tapes. Like actual mixtapes. I got that from my dad. Fast forward 20 years now I just upload it to a server and let it rock. It's still under construction but you can listen at [RADIO.OGDARONC.CO](RADIO.OGDARONC.CO)üçª

I still have to figure out how to pull in the metadata from the stream to display "now playing." If you're reading this and have any tips then let me know.üçª
