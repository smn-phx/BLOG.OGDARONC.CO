#### Integrated learning üçª.

Created a website out of a poem inspired by police brutality. Used some javascript methods learned from hisuperhi.com and added a previously made mix inspired by the same topic. Overall, I'm excited about getting creative with javascript. I think the majority of web development is too capitalistic. We need more art and more utilities that acknowledge humanity.

You can listed to the mix here.
